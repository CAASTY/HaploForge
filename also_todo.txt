Aytug, I need to be really *really* honest with you...

So I've liked you for a... long time, I just... can't seem to advance beyond this.

You know the last time we met, you said that everyone needs therapy.... I've been
in counselling on/off for the past 7 years over issues related to intimacy.

It takes me years to make friends, and there's not many people I really open up to. 
 I can't seem to be able to get close to people, no matter how much I really want to (look at her when you say this).

I just.. I don't want to waste your time. I've already wasted so much.

Do you wan't to go on a proper date. A picnic somewhere, a festival or whatever you fancy? We can go to waterloo and sit by the water if you like.


No it's fine, it's good you've found someone who can fully appreciate you for who you are. And it's also good to get some closure as well. I never knew where I stood with you. Can we still be friends? I just don't want it to be weird the next we meet at suleyman dayis and you're pretty fun to be around.
