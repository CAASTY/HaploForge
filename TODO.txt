I had the sudden crazy idea to render haplotypes using three.js

I just need to know whether the breakpoints/colouring are determined by Haplopainter or by allegro.
Update: Determined by Haplopainter.

 - Functions to consider:
   - ShuffleFounderColors();
      - probably randomizes colours for already split data
   - ProcessHaplotypes();
      - Real fun begins at line 3318, where haplotypes are derived
   - RedrawPed();	
   - AdjustView() if !$batch;	
   - DuplicateHaplotypes()

Steps:
 - Render each haplotype number as an object node
 - Guess each node's inheritance by crawling up tree for unambigious alleles
 - for ambiguous alleles;
    - implement viterbi
    - work to unify both methods
