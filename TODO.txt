Haplotypes should have their own layer for quicker rendering:
	On entering haplomode:
	- Move current pedigree objects from main_layer to haplo_layer
	- Transition to alignment
	- render haplotypes on hapo_layer

	On leaving haplomode:
	- unload haplotypes
	- Transition out of alignment
	- move current pedigree from haplo_layer to main_layer
	- haplo_layer.clear()



Drag and scroll haplotypes:
	- window = 15
	- A view of about window haplotypes at any time,
	  with the next window loaded in with a scroll up and
	  the old window scrolled out of view and unloaded
