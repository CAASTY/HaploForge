Haplotypes should have their own layer for quicker rendering:  [ DONE -- no significant improvement in anims]
	On entering haplomode:
	- Move current pedigree objects from main_layer to haplo_layer
	- Transition to alignment
	- render haplotypes on hapo_layer

	On leaving haplomode:
	- unload haplotypes
	- Transition out of alignment
	- move current pedigree from haplo_layer to main_layer
	- haplo_layer.clear()


Haplotypes should always be aligned [Done]


Drag and scroll haplotypes:
	- window = 20 												[ DONE --]
	- A view of about window haplotypes at any time,            [ DONE ]
	  with the next window loaded in with a scroll up and
	  the old window scrolled out of view and unloaded
	- Window needs an adjuster to be dynamically set to show N markers
	  - Adjuster could be a slider that represents all M markers with start and stop bars



Xlinked scenario for haplotype reconstruction (two alleles to  choose from, not 4)
  -- implemented inheritance patterns, now need to display it using the X_Dom scenario
