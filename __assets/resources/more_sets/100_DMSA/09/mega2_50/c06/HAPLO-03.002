 The above haplotype vector uses the actual allele names within the haplotype   
 representation. There is an option to instead use labels indicating from which 
 founder haplotype an allele is descended; with this option the allele flow     
 through the pedigree is even easier to see. Of course the actual allele names  
 associated with the labels are also provided. This option is batch item #46.2. 
                                                                                
 The above haplotype vector lists for each individual, in order: the letter     
 M or P indicating whether this line is their maternal or paternal haplotype,   
 the individual's name, their mother's name, their father's name, their sex,    
 and their trait phenotype, if any. The haplotype is then listed horizontally.  
                                                                                
 @ is used as the allele name when there is no information in this haplotype    
   vector to determine which allele is in that locus at that individual.        
   This occurs when a founder allele's descent through the pedigree does not    
   place it in any typed locus; this allele slot can be filled by ANY ALLELE.   
   If one must choose an allele, then the maximum likelihood solution is to     
   place into this slot the allele with largest frequency at that marker        
   (this option can be implemented using batch item #46.3).                     
                                                                                
 Separating the maternal and paternal haplotypes is a line of symbols:          
                                                                                
 - is the default symbol;                                                       
 ^ indicates recombination in this interval only in the maternal haplotype      
   (this symbol points towards the marker interval on the maternal haplotype);  
 V indicates recombination in this interval only in the paternal haplotype      
   (this symbol points towards the marker interval on the paternal haplotype);  
 | indicates recombination in both maternal and paternal haplotypes.            
                                                                                
 = highlights maternal or paternal alleles which have been inferred.            
   That is, these alleles were originally undetermined but in this              
   haplotype vector are identical-by-descent to alleles which are known.        
   (This symbol is not applied to untyped alleles that are unambiguously        
   determined by the other alleles which are typed within the pedigree data.)   
                                                                                
 * marks those non-founder ordered genotypes whose phase is not fixed in this   
   haplotype vector; however, the largest likelihood was found using the phase  
   shown above. Of course, phase is also not fixed at any heterozygous founder  
   genotype. This symbol is displayed outside the genotype's paternal allele.   
                                                                                
 Batch item #46.1 gives the option of listing these haplotypes vertically.      
 This may be more convenient for viewing large numbers of marker loci.          
                                                                                
 As mentioned above, for non-founders, the maternal haplotype is listed first,  
 the paternal second. For founders, although the order is arbitrary,            
 when refering to the haplotype that is listed first, we again use the          
 term 'maternal'; the second haplotype is again called the 'paternal'.
